This is a post written in **MDX**.

- It supports Markdown
- And React components!

## Background

This post was originally going to be done via [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), but
I wanted to try out MDX.

## Example

For example, here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
const hello = "world";
console.log(hello);
```

And here's some Python:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Conclusion

I'm glad I tried out MDX. It's a great way to write content with React components. As a famous
person once said:
